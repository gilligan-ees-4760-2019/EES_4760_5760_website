## Reading:

* Railsback & Grimm, Ch. 14.

### Reading Notes:

A good example of asynchronous updating is the 
[model of breeding synchrony](/files/models/chapter_23/Ch_23_4_breeding_synchrony.nlogo), 
described in [Jovani and Grimm (2008)](/files/models/chapter_05/Jovani_Grimm_2008_Breeding.pdf) 
and in Chapter 23, which I have posted on the class web site: 
<https://ees4760.jgilligan.org/files/models/chapter_23/Ch_23_4_breeding_synchrony.nlogo>

**Errata for Chapter 14:**

* Section 14.2.3, p. 187:
  The `foreach` statement in the example code for executing turtles in size order 
  is not compatible with NetLogo versions 6.0 and higher. 
  For version 6.0.2, the statement should be:
  ```
  foreach sort-on [size] turtles
  [
      next-turtle -> ask next-turtle [do-sales]
  ]
  ```

* Section 14.2.5, p. 189:
  This code statement: 
  ```
  while [count patches with [trigger-time > ticks] > 0] 
  ```
  should of course be: 
  ```
  while [any? patches with [trigger-time > ticks] ] 
  ```
  (This Mousetrap model also has a small flaw: it does not represent the 
  possibility that a trap scheduled to be triggered by one ball could be 
  triggered sooner by a different ball that is launched later but has a 
  shorter trajectory.)
