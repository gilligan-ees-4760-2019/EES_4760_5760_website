## Reading:

* Railsback & Grimm, Ch. 13.

### Reading Notes:

**Errata for Chapter 13:**

* Section 13.6, p. 180:
  Starting with version 5.0 of NetLogo, the Programming Guide no longer says 
  that putting items on a list using `fput` is better (faster) than putting them 
  on the end of the list using `lput`. 
  NetLogo's lists were reprogrammed to eliminate this difference and improve the 
  speed of adding and accessing list items.
