## Reading:

* Railsback & Grimm, Ch. 16.

### Reading Notes:

**Errata for Chapter 16:**

* Section 16.4.1, p. 213:
  The description of social status is not clear: it assumes ages are real 
  numbers instead of integers. It should read:
  
    _The social status of a dog can be (a) "pup," meaning its age is less than one; 
    (b) "yearling," with age of 1 year; (c) "subordinate," meaning age is 2 or 
    greater but the dog is not an alpha; (d) "alpha," the dominant individual of its 
    sex in a pack; and (e) "disperser," meaning the dog currently belongs to a 
    disperser group, not a pack._

* Section 16.4.1, p. 213:
  The first bullet of the description of pack formation should start 
  "Determine how many times the disperser group meets another..."

* Section 16.4.1, Fig. 16.1:
  Be aware that this figure does not depict the logistic function parameters in 
  the Wild Dog model description. The figure shows a probability of 0.5 when the 
  number of dogs in the population is 67% of carrying capacity (40 out of 60), 
  while the model description says the probability is 0.5 when the population is 
  50% of carrying capacity. 
  To match the model description, the figure's curve should go through X = 30, Y = 0.5.

* Section 16.4.2, p. 217:
  Setting the dog's variable `my-pack` to the pack that created it (via the 
  statement `set my-pack myself`) can cause a subtle error in the pack formation 
  submodel. Disperser groups cannot form a pack with other disperser groups that 
  originated in the same pack. In most people's code, disperser groups use the value 
  of `my-pack` from one of their dogs to determine which pack they came from. 
  The error can occur when two disperser groups came from packs that have since 
  died; when a disperser dog's pack dies, NetLogo automatically changes its 
  value of `my-pack` to the keyword `nobody`. 
  Because disperser groups cannot form a new pack with another group that has the 
  same value of `my-pack`, groups whose packs have died cannot combine with each 
  other, even if they really came from two different packs. A solution is to set 
  `my-pack` to the unique `who` number of the dog's pack. 
  Instead of `set my-pack myself`, use `set my-pack [who] of myself`. 
  Use a similar statement when new dogs are created in the reproduction submodel. 
  Then change the statements where a dog's value of `my-pack` is compared to a pack, 
  from (for example): 
  ```
  set pack-members dogs with [my-pack = myself]
  ```
  to: 
  ```
  set pack-members dogs with [my-pack = [who] of myself]
  ```
  And because `my-pack` now contains a who number instead of a pack, one of the 
  last lines in the 
  `create-disperser-group-from` code (page 220) needs to be changed, from: 
  ```
  ask dogs-former-pack [set pack-members ... 
  ```
  to: 
  ```
  ask pack dogs-former-pack [set pack-members ...
  ```
  This error appears to have little effect on model results.

* Section 16.4.3, Figure 16.2:
  The figure should look like
