## Homework

Homework #6 is due today: Railsback & Grimm, Ch. 5, Ex. 5.11 (grad. students). See the homework assignment sheet for details.

## Reading:

* Railsback & Grimm, Ch. 7.

### Reading Notes:

There is not very much reading for today. Read Chapter 7 of _Agent-Based Modeling_ carefully (it's very short) The point of this chapter is to help you get ideas for your term research project.

Before class, I want you to read through the research project assignment and think about what you might want to do for a research project. We will spend class talking about possible research projects.
