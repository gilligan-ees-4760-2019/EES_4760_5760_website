<h2>Homework</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Study the code and ODD of the model you chose, play with the model and run some BehaviorSpace experiments to examine its
output.
Turn in a 3–5 page (double-spaced) write-up about the model.
If the model does not have a published ODD, try to write your own to describe what it does.</p>
<p>If you are writing your own model from scratch, turn in a 3–5 page write-up about how you are approaching designing your model and the experiments you will run with it.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes on Homework:</h3>
<p>If you are working with a published model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the purpose of the mdoel, the important features about its design
and structure.</li>
<li>Discuss whether there are weaknesses in the model design and whether you
might have represented the system differently if you were writing the model
from scratch.</li>
<li>Present the output from the model (BehaviorSpace experiments or interactively
playing with it) and discuss what you learn about the system from that.</li>
<li>Discuss something you didn’t learn from the model that you would like to
study by extending the model.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are writing your own model from scratch, then you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe in detail the problem your model will investigate. Present one or
two specific questions that you will try to answer with your model.</li>
<li>Present the background that you will draw on to design your model
(theory and published empirical research or observations) and explain how
you plan to use this knowledge to design your model.</li>
<li>Describe the “Overview” part of your ODD:
<ul>
<li><p>What is the purpose of the model?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the entities (agents, patches)?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the state variables (agents-own, patches-own, and global
variables) that characterize the state of the model and its entities
at any point in time?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the spatial and temporal scales of the model? How large is
a patch? How long is a tick? These don’t need to be specifically defined
in meters, kilometers, seconds, or days, but you should at least
think qualitatively about how finely or coarsely your model divides
space and time with regard to the phenomena you’re investigating.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the process and scheduling: What happens during a tick?
What do agents and patches do? What order to the different steps
occur in?</p>
<p>When multiple agents or patches are going to take a given
action, how does your model decide the order in which they act (i.e.,
who goes first, second, etc.)? By default, agents and patches act in a
random order when you write code like <code>ask turtles [...]</code> but you may
want to have the turtles queue in a specific order.</p>
<p>When turtles or patches take several different actions (e.g., eat,
move, sleep) does one turtle do all three actions, then the next
turtle does all three, and so forth, or do all the turtles do the
first action, then all turtles do the second action,
then all do the third (for details, see pp. 40–41 in Chapter 3
and also Chapter 14).</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the kinds of experiments you might do with your model to
investigate your research questions (e.g., what parameters will you
vary in the experiment and what outputs will you measure?)</p></li>
</ul></li>
