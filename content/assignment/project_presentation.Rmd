## Homework

* You will make a ten-minute presentation in class about your model (seven minutes of talking and three minutes for questions).

### Notes on Homework:

There will not be time to go into all the details in your presentation, so focus on:
* the big question you were addressing,
* a short description of the approach you took to answer it using an agent-based model,
* what you learned from running the model.
