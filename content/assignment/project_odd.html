<h3>Notes on Homework:</h3>
<p>If you are working with a published model that has an ODD,
your ODD should modify the published one to include the changes you plan to
make to investigate your new research question.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re writing a new model from scratch, you should turn in a full ODD
for your model.</p>
