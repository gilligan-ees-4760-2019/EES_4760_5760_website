<h2>Homework</h2>
<ul>
<li>Turn in a written report about your research project. Your report should follow the model of a research report for <em>Science</em> magazine:</li>
</ul>
<div id="notes-on-homework" class="section level3">
<h3>Notes on Homework:</h3>
<p>Your report should include the following:
* <strong>Title:</strong> Maximum of 90 characters
* <strong>Abstract:</strong> A one-paragraph abstract that explains to a general reader
why you did this project, what the big results were, and what important
things they show us regarding your research question.
* <strong>Text:</strong> Up to 2000 words (around eight pages, double-spaced), not
including the abstract, references, notes, or captions. Up to four
figures or tables.</p>
<p>The text should:
* Give a short introduction to the research question and explain why it’s
interesting,
* Describe the methods you used to answer the question (the model design,
the experiments you conducted, and the methods you used to analyze the
output from the experiments),
* Describe the results of your experiments (figures or tables are useful
here),
* Discuss the significance of the results with respect to your research
question
* Present short conclusions about what you learned about your research
question and what the next steps for future research using your model
might be.
* <strong>References:</strong> In your text, you should cite sources that you used
(e.g., the source of the model you modified, books or articles you
consulted to learn more about the subject of your study, and sources of
authority to support assertions that you make in the text). You may use
any standard reference format (e.g., Chicago, APA, MLA, etc.) and you may
use either numbered or author-date style citations.
* <strong>Supporting Materials:</strong> You should have a separate folder within
your project folder called “Supporting Materials” where you should put
the final <code>.nlogo</code> file for your model, output files from your experimental
runs, any input data files you used in running your model (e.g., something
like the digital elevation map we used in the butterfly mating model),
and any additional material that would allow someone else to
reproduce your research. The ODD for your model should be in the
“Info” pane of your model, but you may also submit a text document with
the ODD if you wish as part of the Supporting Materials.</p>
<p>You may also optionally include a supplementary document with text,
figures, and tables that don’t fit into the formal report. If you
produce a lot of figures or tables, this is a good place to put them.</p>
<p>You may refer to the supplementary materials in the text of your report,
but the main text of your paper should stand alone in describing the
problem, the general approach you took with your model and experiments,
what you found, and why it was significant. The supporting material is
for providing extra details that don’t fit into the main paper and for
providing the code and data necessary for someone else to reproduce and
extend your research.</p>
<p>The main paper should be in a Word or PDF document with the filename
<code>&lt;lastname&gt;_final_paper.docx</code> or <code>&lt;lastname&gt;_final_paper.pdf</code> (with your
own last name in place of <code>&lt;lastname&gt;</code>). Make a folder in Box called
<code>Final_Paper</code> and put your paper there. Make a subfolder inside
<code>Final_Paper</code> called <code>Supporting_Material</code> and put all of your supporting
material there (ODD document, NetLogo model, etc.).</p>
