## Homework

* Turn in an ODD for extending your chosen model to ask new questions.

### Notes on Homework:

If you are working with a published model that has an ODD,
your ODD should modify the published one to include the changes you plan to
make to investigate your new research question.

If you're writing a new model from scratch, you should turn in a full ODD
for your model.
