1. What kinds of things (both human and natural) cause the earth's climate to change?
1. Why are carbon and energy so important?
1. Very roughly, how much has the earth's temperature changed in the past and how much do we expect it to change in the next few centuries?
1. Should we worry about climate change and human activities that cause it?


### Questions to think about:

1. What is climate, and how is it different from weather?
1. What determines the temperature of the earth, and what are some things that can cause the temperature to change?
1. What is global warming? What kinds of risks do we worry about in connection with it?
1. What are several reasons why we emphasize carbon dioxide (<%COO%>) when we talk about global warming?
1. About how much has earth's temperature varied in the past thousand years? In the last 25,000 years? How much do we expect it to change in the next hundred years?
1. What are some extreme climatic or weather events that we've seen recently around the world (think of things in the assigned readings, but also other things you've experienced or heard about in the news).
1. What kinds of trends do we see in natural disasters?
1. How would you know whether or not the kinds of events and trends in your answers
  to the two previous questions are caused by human interference with climate?
1. What possible responses can we (the population of the earth) take to respond to global warming?

203,INTRO_CLIMATE_CHANGE,NORDHAUS,Ch. 2--3,,,"_<%MEDIUM_NORDHAUS%>_ is written by William Nordhaus, a prominent economist. He has a different emphasis than Archer does. Read Chapter 1 more carefully, and mostly skim Chapter 2 lightly, but do pay attention to the section on p. 15 where he asks, ""why read a book about climate change by an economist?""  Chapter 1 presents an outline of the book. As you read it, pay attention to the way Nordhaus connects the science and economics of climate change.  The figure on p. 10 illustrates these connections and it is important to understand what he is saying with it.

At the end of the chapter, Nordhaus presents three things he thinks people around the planet **must** do about climate change. Later in the semester we will read a book that disagrees vehemently with most of Nordhaus's analysis and recommendations. For now, ask yourself whether you agree with Nordhaus's three points, why you agree or disagree, and whether he has made a strong case for these points in this chapter.


### Questions to think about

1. Why does Nordhaus emphasize the difference between **managed**, **unmanaged**, and **unmanageable** human and natural systems?
1. What does Nordhaus mean by **tipping points** in the earth's climate system? Why are they important?
1. What does Nordhaus mean by **mitigation** of climate change? (p. 6)
1. Why does Nordhaus think that ""the economics of climate change is straightforward?"" What policy does his ""straightforward"" analysis recommmend?
1. What does Nordhaus mean when he calls emission of <%COO%> into the atmosphere an **externality**? (p. 6) Why is this important for policymakers and for his own preferred policy?

(i.e., you don't need to worry about equations 4.1--4.3).
Graduate students do need to know and be able to apply these equations.

You should understand why molecules with many atoms are
more powerful greenhouse gases than molecules with fewer atoms. Can a single
atom (e.g., noble gases such as helium) act as greenhouse gases? What about
nitrogen (<%NTWO%>) and oxygen (<%OTWO%>) molecules, which make up almost 99% of
the atmosphere?

What is the ""atmospheric window,"" that spans the range of about
800--1250 <%WAVENUMBER%> (wavelengths of 8--12 <%MICRON%>)?

### Understanding emissions spectra seen by satellites

**This is important:** The key to this section is understanding diagrams,
such as Fig. 4.3 and 4.5. These diagrams show the brightness of
infrared light emitted at different frequencies. The smooth lines correspond
to the radiation a perfect blackbody would give off at different temperatures.
Hotter bodies give off more energy and cooler bodies give off less.

The jagged line is the actual radiation given off by the atmosphere, as seen by
a satellite in space. Because the atmosphere is cooler higher up, emissions that follow a cooler
blackbody curve for some part of the spectrum mean the infrared at
those wavenumbers is emitted by greenhouse gases higher in the atmosphere.
Brighter emissions that follow a hotter blackbody curve for some part of
the spectrum means hotter temperatures, and hence emission at those wavenumbers
comes from gases closer to the ground.

As you add more of a gas, it absorbs more infrared light, so the emissions from
the ground or from lower in the atmosphere can't get through---they're absorbed
by higher layers of the atmosphere---and thus, the only emissions that get out to
space come from higher (and thus colder) layers. This is why you see lower
emissions (colder temperatures) for the wavenumbers at which powerful greenhouse
gases, such as <%COO%> and ozone, absorb.

Here are some review questions to check whether you understand this material
well:

* Water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas. Why do you suppose we don't
  see extremely cold temperatures for the part of the spectrum (100--600 <%WAVENUMBER%>)
  where _it_ absorbs?
* If greenhouse gases make earth warmer, why does adding <%COO%> in
  make the emissions temperatures become smaller in Fig. 4-5?


### Band saturation

**This is important for understanding why some greenhouse gases are more
powerful than others** What is band saturation? Why does increasing <%COO%>
from 10 to 100 parts per million or from 100 to 1000 parts per million have much
less effect than increasing it from 0 to 10 parts per million? Think by analogy.
Suppose you smear a tablespoon of black ink all over a white piece of
paper. How much will that affect its brightness? Now suppose you smear four
more tablespoons of ink on the stained paper. Which has the bigger effect on
the whiteness of the paper: the first spill of ink, or the second (much bigger)
one?

Now, looking at the atmosphere with the current amount of greenhouse gases,
can you speculate why adding a million molecules of methane to the atmosphere
will produce 20 times more warming than adding a million molecules of <%COO%>?",0,0,0,0,0,0
600,VERTICAL_STRUCTURE,ARCHER,Ch. 5,,,"  The key thing in this chapter is understanding why the troposphere gets colder as
  you go higher, and how this phenomenon (described by the term **lapse rate**),
  contributes to the greenhouse effect.

  First, the chapter starts by defining a **skin layer**, which is an
  important concept, and connects it to the greenhouse effect.

  Next, it moves on to describe how air pressure varies with altitude. I
  find the discussion on pp. 46--49 more confusing than it needs to be.
  Don't get bogged down in the details of _why_ the equation at
  the bottom of p. 48 is true. Just understand _what_ that equation
  tells you:
\[
  P(z) = 1~\text{atm}\cdot e^{-z/8~\text{km}}
\]
You might find it easier and more intuitive to work with another way to write
the same equation:
\[
  P(z) = 1~\text{atm}\cdot 2^{-z/5.5~\text{km}}
\]
If we think of it this way, it's intuitive that every 5.5 km you go up in the
atmosphere, the pressure drops by half: at 5.5 km, it's 50% what it is at sea
level. At 11.0 km it's 25%; at 16.5 km it's 12.5%, and so on.

Third, we learn why air cools off as it rises through the atmosphere. It's
because it expands as the pressure surrounding it drops. Similarly, as air descends to lower
altitudes, it compresses and gets hotter.

Fourth, we learn about latent heat from water evaporating and condensing. Latent
heat is responsible for a large fraction of the heat transport around the atmosphere. Latent heat
is also very important because it affects lapse rate. How does the lapse rate in
**saturated** air (i.e., air with 100% relative humidity) differ from the lapse rate
in **unsaturated** air (with relative humidity $<100%$)? Why? (Hint: the relavant
material appears in the section on **moist convection**, not the section on latent heat.)

Fifth, we learn about convection: as you heat air it tends to rise and this
moves heat around the atmosphere. The key concept regarding convection is **stability** vs.
**instability**. Unstable air undergoes convection (as the troposphere does), whereas
stable air does not, and instead remains **stratified**, as the stratosphere does.

Sixth (and finally), we put everything together to see the connection between
lapse rates and the greenhouse effect. The key result is that adding greenhouse gases raises the height
of the ""skin"" and this added height, together with the lapse rate, tells us how much the
surface temperature will warm up. The book summarizes these five points
concisely on p. 55.

902,OCEAN_BIOSPHERE_FEEDBACKS,FEEDBACK_HANDOUT,,,,"
* In the handout, pay close attenton to two different ways of talking about feedbacks:
    If we **force** the climate by changing the brightness of the sun, the bare-rock temperature of the earth adjusts until the average flux of outgoing radiation equals the average flux of incoming radiation. Sometimes we count this adjustment as a negative feedback (called the **Stefan-Boltzmann feedback**) that maintains radiative balance. Other times we consider it to be a simple response to the changing amount of radiation.

    The handout calls this adjustment the Stefan-Boltzmann feedback ($f_0$) and calculates the other feedbacks (water-vapor, lapse-rate, ice-albedo, etc.) as additional feedbacks. This lets us write a straightforward equation for the effect of all the different feedbacks on the earth's temperature, but it is important to be clear that when most people (including most scientists) talk about feedbacks in the climate system, they do not include the Stefan-Boltzmann feedback.

What I am looking for you to get out of this is a sense of the different kinds of impacts that climate change might have on our lives and the lives of people around the planet.

* Pay particular attention to the distinction Nordhaus draws between **managed**, **unmanaged**, and **unmanageable** systems.
* Also pay attention to the discussions of **adaptation** and **mitigation**.

    * **Mitigating factors** mean aspects of climate change that may be 
      beneficial and mitigate the damage caused by the harmful aspects. 
      This can be confusing because in the context of climate policy 
      **mitigation** usually means reducing the amount of climate change 
      (e.g., by reducing greenhouse gas emissions), whereas **mitigating factors** 
      are things that reduce the impact that a given amount of climate change 
      will have on people's lives.
      
    * **Adaptation** means changes people make in the way they live and the 
      kinds of economic activities they pursue in order to adapt to living in a 
      different climate.

      Adaptation and mitigating factors are important because they show us that 
      there can be more to climate change policy than just reducing greenhouse 
      gas emissions.
      Again, to point out how confusing this terminology can be, 
      _mitigating factors_ (things that reduce the impact of climate change on

      _mitigation_ (reducing greenhouse gas emissions).

2301,POLICY_MYTHS,PIELKE,Ch. 2,,,"In _<%MEDIUM_PIELKE%>_, Pielke addresses three what he calls three myths of climate policy:

1. We lack political will to do anything about climate change
1. We must trade off the economy for the environment
1. We have all the technology we need to solve the problem

With respect to myth #2, consider this quotation, from a story on National Public Radio on October 2, 2010:

>  Republican pollster Frank Luntz says it's clear why the politics of climate change are so different [in 2010] than they were in 2008. 
> ""_What has changed is that the American economy went to hell. And when you ask voters are they more concerned about destroying 
> their environment over the next 100 years or rehabilitating their economy over the next 100 weeks, they'll choose the economy over 
> the environment any day_,"" Luntz says.

As you read Chapter 2 of _<%MEDIUM_PIELKE%>_, critically assess Luntz's arguments. Pay special attention to the ""**Iron Law**,"" described on pp. 46--50. This will be a crucial piece of Pielke's analysis throughout the book.

On pp. 51--58 of _<%MEDIUM_PIELKE%>_, Pielke writes about the idea of ""**stabilization wedges**,"" introduced by Robert Socolow and Stephen Pacala, in the context of dismissing myth #3. The stabilization wedge concept is very important in climate policy and we will discuss them further later in the semester, so read these pages reasonably carefully and keep in mind that Pielke's dismissal is just one opinion. A number of scholars and policy experts agree with Pielke, but many disagree as well. This is a topic on which it's important to think for yourself.

After dismissing many myths, Pielke offers his own ideas for how to approach climate policy.

Nordhaus shows that in the past decade, we have seen an increasing divide between what scientists think about the facts of climate change and what the public thinks, that this widening gap has proceeded together with a growing ideological divide between liberals and Democrats on one side and conservatives and Republicans on the other. He observes on p. 311 that ""Climate change is an area where the political leaders have led public opinion.""

Nordhaus then proposes a way for small-government political conservatives, such as himself, to close the divide between the parties and between scientists and the public.

Key concepts that you should understand are:

* We will be discussing national and global energy consumption in terms of **quads** (see p. 63 in Climate Fix). You should have a good feeling for how much a quad is and how many quads the US consumes.
* The **Kaya Identity** and the factors that go into it (p. 71 of _<%MEDIUM_PIELKE%>_; you might also go back and quickly review pp. 19--23 of _<%MEDIUM_NORDHAUS%>_, which we read for Aug. 28).:

    * Total <%COO%> emissions ($F$)
    * Population ($P$)
    * Per-capita GDP ($g$)
    * Energy intensity of the economy ($e$)
    * Carbon intensity of the energy supply ($f$)

* How would you make sense of the fact that the U.S. has a much greater $F$ than India and a slightly smaller $F$ than China, but a much smaller $e$ and $f$ than either India or China?
* What trends have we seen over the past several decades in the energy intensity of the economy and the carbon intensity of the energy supply? (pp. 74--79 of _<%MEDIUM_PIELKE%>_ and Fig. 3 on p. 22 of _<%MEDIUM_NORDHAUS%>_)
* What is **primary energy consumption** and how does it differ from other kinds of energy consumption?
* Why does Pielke argue that **energy dependence** leads to **energy insecurity**?
* In _<%MEDIUM_NORDHAUS%>_, look at Figure 23 and the table of carbon emissions on p. 159. How do different fuels compare in terms of carbon emissions?
* In _<%MEDIUM_NORDHAUS%>_, look at Table 6 and get a sense of what activities cause the most <%COO%> emissions.
* What does the Kaya Identity and the material from _<%MEDIUM_NORDHAUS%>_ suggest for where we should focus in our economy to reduce <%COO%> emissions?

For today, we will focus on **solar radiation management**: Techniques for cancelling out the enhanced greenhouse effect by blocking sunlight from reaching the earth.

* As you read Pielke, pay attention to his discussion of the big picture. What does he mean by a **technological fix**, and what does he think about technological fixes for environmental problems?
* What are Daniel Sarewitz's criteria for successful technological fixes?
* In the context of technological fixes, Pielke describes climate change as a ""wicked problem."" This is a phrase with a specific meaning in public policy analysis. It comes from a 1973 paper,^[H.W.J. Rittel and M.M. Weber, ""[Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01405730),"" Policy Sciences **4**, 155 (1973).] which defines ""wicked problems"" as possessing ten different properties, all of which make it very difficult, even impossible, to find satisfactory solutions. A few of these properties include: Wicked problems have high stakes, so it is unacceptable to choose a solution that proves ineffective. They are plagued by uncertainty, so no one can tell in advance whether a solution will work well. They invoilve important tradeoffs, so anything that makes a solution attractive to one constituency will make it unattractive to another. They are irreversible, so trial and error is not an effective approach for finding good solutions.

    As you read this chapter, think about how the problem of geoengineering the climate fits the criteria of a wicked problem.
* What does Pielke think about solar radiation management in terms of Sarewitz's criteria?
* Pielke begins this chapter by discussing geoengineering as a ""**Plan B**"" for climate policy. What does he mean by this?
* Where Pielke talks about ""Plan B,"" Nordhaus describes geoengineering as ""**salvage therapy**"" for the planet. How does his account of solar radiation management compare to Pielke's? Where do the two agree and where do they disagree?
* Nordhaus, as an economist, focuses a lot on costs, comparing the costs and the benefits of any policy. How does he asses the costs and benefits of geoengineering?
* The short paper by Hegerl and Solomon presents solar radiation management geoengineering from the perspective of two top climate scientists. As you read their thoughts, which focus almost entirely on the scientific aspects, how do you think of this in comparison to the policy focus in Nordhaus's and Pielke's discussions?

3001,COST_OF_MITIGATION,NORDHAUS,Ch. 14,pp. 157--165,,"Here, we focus on the cost of reducing emissions. You should skim the material from Ch. 14 lightly and focus on reading Ch. 15 carefully.
Remember how, in the reading notes for Oct. 9, I warned you about the potential confusion between ""mitigating factors,"" (the benefits of global warming, such as reduced heating costs for people who live in cold climates and longer growing seasons for farmers, which can offset some of the harms) and ""mitigation,"" which means cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we are talking about the latter.

* Nordhaus distinguishes two kinds of economic analysis of the cost of mitigation: Top-down and bottom-up (pp. 174--76 and Fig. 25). What is the difference? Do you think one is more reliable than the other? Why or why not?
* Nordhaus discusses two aspects of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions: the technical aspects that determine what a perfect policy that is efficiently implemented could do; and the human aspects, which cause policies to be imperfectly designed and inefficently implemented in the real world. Compare the two curves in Fig. 26.

3100,DISCOUNTING,,,,,"Time-discounting is one of the most contentious and controversial aspects of the economics and ethics of climate change. Entire books have been written about this, and one class will not do justice to the topic.

* As you read this chapter in Nordhaus, try to follow the distinctions Nordhaus draws between several aspects of discounting:

    * **Pure time preference:** If I offer you a choice of getting a free dinner at a nice restaurant sometime this month or getting the same dinner five years from now, you would almost certainly prefer to get the nice dinner this month. Given the choice of getting something nice now, or in the near future, versus having to wait a long time, most people don't want to wait.
    * **Opportunity cost:** If I offered you the choice of \$100 now versus in five years, as opposed to the fancy meal, something else comes into the picture: If you got the money now, but chose not to spend it right away, you could invest it so that in five years, you would have more than \$100. Spending money today rather than investing it for the future produces an opportunity cost (missing out on the compounding interest), which contributes another piece to the problem of discounting and the value of time.
    * **Fairness and economic growth:** Economic growth has dramatically reduced poverty around the world over the past centuries. The decline of poverty has been especially rapid in the past half-century. If this trend continues, people living a few centuries in the future will have average per-capita incomes much more than 10 times what the average person earns today. Thus, spending money today to reduce the costs of climate change for future generations might be like taking from the poor (today's generation) to benefit the rich (future generations).

* Graduate students should read the two articles in Science (and undergrads are welcome to read them if you're interested). Each is a bit less than two pages and they are very clear. These articles are a nice distillation of the kinds of economic/ethical arguments about what it means to be fair and just that are very common in environmental policy, and especially in climate policy.

    There are no easy answers, and the challenge has led philosopher Stephen Gardiner to call the problem of climate change ""a perfect moral storm.""
* The optional article by the economist, John Quiggin, is a much more technical discussion of the ethical and economic conundrums that arise from reducing the value of life and suffering to a mathematical equation about time. It's very good, but it's purely optional and you should not feel obliged to read it if you are not really excited to nerd out about these things.

* In these chapters, Pielke and Nordhaus offer different accounts of the history of international treaties and policies to manage climate change.
* Much of the focus is on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), signed in 1992 and ratified by all 193 member states of the United Nations.
* The UNFCCC is legally binding on its signatories, and requires them to "" stabiliz[e] greenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system."" A problem is that the Framework did not define what constituted ""dangerous anthropogenic interference,"" or spell out any specific actions that the signatories would have to take under the treaty.
* In subsequent years, much of the world's scientific and climate policy elites arrived at a rough consensus that raising the average temperature of the earth by more than 2<%DEGREE_CELSIUS%> relative to preindustrial temperatures would constitute dangerous interference. Both Nordhaus and Pielke present critical examinations of this judgment.
* The details of implementing the pledge under UNFCCC (both defining 'dangerous interference"" and deciding on specific actions) was left to subsequent negotiations, and the signatory nations have met every year at ""conferences of parties"" (COPs) to hammer out details. The most important implementation agreement was a treaty signed in Kyoto in 1998, but never ratified by the United States. Both Nordhaus and Pielke discuss the Kyoto treaty and its pros and cons.
* As you read this history and the discussion of the goal of limiting warming to no more than 2<%DEGREE_CELSIUS%> above pre-industrial temperatures, try to become familiar with the history and think critically about the kinds of policies that were pursued and those that were not given serious consideration.
