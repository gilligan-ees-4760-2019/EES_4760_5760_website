* These two exercises use two different models. In both models, you adjust parameters to achieve radiative balance (where the heat going out equals the heat coming in), but you adjust different parameters in each model, and each model has a different way for you to tell whether the earth is at radiative equilibrium.

    * The \RRTM full-spectrum model is a radiative-convective model that considers the impact of lapse rate on the radiative balance. You can adjust the amount of sunlight hitting the earth, the albedo, the surface temperature, the lapse rate, and other parameters including the amount of cloud cover at different altitudes. The model then divides the atmosphere into many layers and at each layer, it calculates the amount of heat going up and down in the form of shortwave radiation (sunlight) and longwave radiation emitted by the earth and the atmosphere. The model also reports about the balance of heat going up and down at the top of the atmosphere. Your goal is to adjust parameters until the model reports that ""If the earth has these properties \dots then it loses as much energy as it gains.""  You can also move your mouse over the yellow and purple arrows, which represent shortwave and longwave radiation, respectively, and the computer will show you the amount of heat flowing up or down (in watts per square meter) for that kind of radiation.
    * The <%MODTRAN%> model ignores shortwave light and only considers longwave (infrared) light emitted by the earth's surface and atmosphere. When you start it up, you pick a locality (for this exercise, use ""1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere"" just as you did for the exercises in Chapter 4) and the model will initialize to conditions of radiative balance at that locality (for the 1976 U.S. standard atmosphere, this is \SI{260.18}{W/m^2}). You can then adjust all sorts of parameters (the concentrations of different gases, the conditions of clouds or rain, and the temperature of the ground), and the model will calculate the new upward longwave heat flux at the altitude you specify.  You want to make a note of the upward IR heat flux for the default conditions before you start changing things, and then when you change parameters, such as the amount of <%COO%> in the atmosphere, you can adjust the ground temperature until the upward IR heat flux returns to its initial value.

* For Exercise 1, use the \RRTM full-spectrum model, at \href{http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/}{\nolinkurl{climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/}}. For this model, you set the lapse rate, <%COO%> concentration, etc., and the model automatically calculates the imbalance between $I_{\text{in}}$ and $I_{\text{out}}$. You can then adjust the surface temperature until the model reports, ""\dots{} then it loses as much energy as it gains.""
* There's a typo in exercise 2(a):
The Stefan-Boltzmann constant should be\\
$$\sigma = \SI{5.67E-8}{\watt/\meter^2\kelvin^4}\quad\text{($10^{-8}$, not $10^8$).}$$
* For exercise 2, use the <%MODTRAN%> model. Choose ""1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere"" for Location and keep the altitude at its default value of \SI{70}{km}. How would you calculate the skin altitude from this model?
* When exercise 2(d) asks you to add cirrus clouds, use the ""NOAA Cirrus model.""

I have written these exercises instead to give you a chance to apply the same concepts.


1.[Exercise \#1:]
    Use the <%MODTRAN%> model with the ""1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere"" and vary the clouds. 
    Note that this model does not consider incoming shortwave light, and therefore it ignores the albedo effect of clouds. It only calculates the effect of the clouds on outgoing longwave light for a given surface temperature. One way to think about this is that it looks at the effect the clouds have at night.
[a)]
      \setlength{\parskip}{1ex}
    1. Run the model three times: First with clear skies, then with ""Altostratus: Cloud Base \SI{2.4}{\kilo\meter} Top \SI{3.0}{\kilo\meter},"" and finally with ""Stratus: Cloud Base \SI{.33}{\kilo\meter} Top \SI{1.0}{\kilo\meter}.""
        Describe the change in \(I_{\text{out}}\) for each type of clouds:

        * Is the effect warming or cooling?
        * Which type of cloud has the bigger effect on $I_{\text{out}}$?
        * Why do you see the difference between the two types of clouds?

%
    1.  Starting set the altitude to zero and select ""Looking up."" When you are looking up, the model reports the longwave radiation coming down to the surface from the atmosphere and hitting the earth's surface. This heat is in addition to whatever heat the earth gets from shortwave solar radiation.

        For simplicity, think of this as the conditions at night, when the sun is not shining: without sunlight, the temperature of the ground will be determined by balancing the outgoing heat with the heat radiated downward by the warm atmosphere and clouds.

        First, note the downward longwave heat flux ($I_{\text{down}}$) with clear sky (no clouds or rain). Then turn on altostratus clouds and note the change in $I_{\text{down}}$. Next, turn on stratus clouds and note the change in $I_{\text{down}}$.

        Answer the following questions:

        * How does \(I_{\text{down}}\) change when you add clouds?
        * Do the clouds have a heating or cooling effect? Why?
        * Which clouds have a greater heating or cooling effect? Why?


1.[Exercise \#2:] Use the \RRTM model.
[a)]
      \setlength{\parskip}{1ex}
    1. First set the model to its default parameters. It should report,
          ""If the earth has these properties \dots then it loses as much energy as it gains.""
          Move your mouse over the arrows at the top and bottom of the graph. The orange arrows are shortwave (mostly visible) light, and the purple arrows are longwave (far-infrared) radiation. How much shortwave and longwave light is absorbed by the ground (the downward arrows at the bottom) and how much of each is emitted to space (the upward arrows at the top)?
    1. Next, add 100% high clouds (set ""High cloud (fraction)"" to 1.0). Record the total gain or loss of of heat, and the amount of shortwave and longwave radiation absorbed by the surface and emitted to space. Clouds affect both longwave and shortwave heat fluxes. Which kind of radiation changed more?
    1. Now do the same thing for low clouds: set ""High cloud (fraction)"" to zero and ""Low cloud (fraction)"" to 1.0. Which kind of radiation changed more, compared to the no-cloud condition?
    1. With the low cloud fraction still set to 1.0 (100%), change the drop radius from \SIrange{10}{8}{\micro\meter}. How does this change the heat flux?
    1. Now set the cloud fraction to zero and double the <%COO%>. How does this change the heat flux? How does the effect of doubling <%COO%> compare to the effect of changing the droplet size for the low clouds? You can see how important it is to get the cloud droplet size right in climate models!

1. [Exercise \#3:] The ""climate sensitivity"" ($\Delta T_{\text{2x}}$) refers to the change in temperature when you double the amount of <%COO%> in the atmosphere. Here, we will examine how the water vapor feedback affects climate sensitivity.
[a)]
    1. Run the \RRTM model with the default parameters. Write down the ground temperature.
            \medskip

            Next, double <%COO%> and note the change in energy balance. At the
            beginning of the exercise, the earth was in radiative equilibrium. Changing <%COO%> disturbed
            this equilibrium and produced a radiative imbalance where $I_{\text{out}} \neq I_{\text{in}}$.
            Adjust the surface temperature to bring the earth back into balance.
            \medskip


        * What is the new temperature?
        * How much did the earth warm or cool? This temperature change for doubling <%COO%> is what we call the **climate sensitivity**,
                    or $\Delta T_{2\times<%COO%>}$.

%
    1. Set <%COO%> back to the default value (400 ppm) and set relative humidity to zero. This turns off the water vapor feedback.
            Adjust the surface temperature offset until the earth loses as much energy as it gains.
            Write down this temperature.
            \medskip

            Now double the <%COO%> and adjust the surface temperature to bring the heat back into balance.

        * How much did the temperature change?

%
    1. Compare the climate sensitivity with zero relative humidity to the sensitivity with
            the default value of 80% relative humidity. The difference is the effect of water vapor feedback.

        * What was the amplification factor of the water vapor feedback
                (the ratio of the climate sensitivity $\Delta T_{2\times<%COO%>}$ with water vapor
                feedback to $\Delta T_{2\times<%COO%>}$ without it)?


%
1. [Exercise \#4 (Graduate students only):] Repeat exercise 3, but using the <%MODTRAN%> model instead of \RRTM.
[a)]
    1. Set the model to the 1976 U.S. Standard atmosphere, <%COO%> to 400 ppm, and the water vapor scale to 1. Click on ""Save This Run to Background.""

        * Note the upward IR heat flux.
        * Double the <%COO%> concentration.
        * Adjust the ground temperature offset and set ""Holding Fixed"" to ""Relative Humidity."" (the ""Holding Fixed"" option will not appear until you change the ground temperature offset) Adjust the ground temperature offset until the upward IR heat flux returns to its original value. The change in temperature is the climate sensitivity including water-vapor feedback.

    1. Now return <%COO%> to 400 ppm and set the water vapor scale to 0. This takes all the water out of the atmosphere so there is no water vapor feedback. Check that your locality is still ""1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere.

        * Adjust the ground temperature offset until the upward IR heat flux returns to the value it had at the beginning of part (a).
        * Double the <%COO%> concentration.
        * Adjust the ground temperature offset until you restore the upward IR heat flux to its original value.

          The difference in ground temperature offset from 400 to 800 ppm is the climate sensitivity
          with no water vapor feedback.
    1. What is the amplifying factor of water vapor feedback? How does the amplifying factor you calculated with <%MODTRAN%> compare to the value you calcuated with \RRTM?

    methane and <%COO%> on timescales of 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 years.

The <%SLUGULATOR%> model simulates releasing a large amount of <%COO%> and methane and then calculates what happens over time. At time zero, the concentration of each gas is the natural level from shortly before the industrial revolution: 280 ppm of <%COO%> and 1.6 ppm of methane. At one year, a large amount of each gas is released instantly (after this, there are no further emissions of either gas).
[a)]
1. Run the model using the default model input parameters, setting the left graph to ""Concentrations"" and the right graph to ""Surface T Anomaly"".  Set the time scale on the bottom to show 10 years.

Move your mouse over the graphs to measure the exact values (a ""tooltip"" will pop up next to the cursor telling the time in years and the value of the line on the graph: concentration of <%COO%> or methane, or the warming due to that gas). Be aware that on the concentration graph, the concentration of <%COO%> is plotted against the left axis while methane is plotted against the right axis.

What happens to the concentrations of methane and carbon dioxide? Why does the concentration of <%COO%> continue to rise after the first year, when methane is falling?
1. What is the warming due to methane at 1 year and at 10 years? What is the warming due to <%COO%> at 1 and 10 years? (Use the mouse to examine the time-dependent temperature plotted on the graphs, not the ""Time-integrated temperature"" in the table at the top of the page). Calculate the ratio of methane-warming to <%COO%>-warming at each time.
1. Change the time scale to show 25, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 years. Make a table showing the warming due to each gas and the ratio of methane-warming to <%COO%>-warming at 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 years.
1. Plot the ratio of methane-warming to <%COO%>-warming over time.
1. Why does the ratio change with time?
1. Generating electricity by burning natural gas (methane) releases much less <%COO%> than generating the same amount of electricity by burning coal. ""Fracking"" has dramatically lowered the cost of natural gas, so many people think this will let us reduce <%COO%> emissions significantly by shutting down coal-fired generating plants and replacing them with natural-gas generation. However, gas wells that use fracking may also leak a lot of methane. Comment on what the significance of this homework exercise is to the debate over whether fracking will help or hurt the problem of global warming.
","The <%GEOCARB%> model has two time periods: First, it runs for 5 million years with the ""Spinup"" settings in order to bring the carbon cycle and climate into a steady state. Then, at time zero, it abruptly changes the parameters to the ""Simulation"" settings and also dumps a ""spike"" of <%COO%> into the atmosphere and runs for another 2 million years with the new parameters to see how the climate and carbon cycle adjust to the new parameters and the <%COO%> spike.

Notice that some of the graphs show short-time behavior (the first 100,000 years after the transition) and some show the long-time behavior (two million years after the transition).

The quantities that are graphed include:

1.[pCO2] is the concentration of <%COO%> in the atmosphere, in parts per million.
1.[WeatC] is the amount of <%COO%> weathered from carbonate rocks and moved to the oceans.
1.[BurC] is the amount of carbonate converted into limestone and buried on the ocean floor.
1.[WeatS] is the amount of \silica weathered from silicate rocks and moved to the oceans.
1.[Degas] is the amount of <%COO%> released to the atmosphere by volcanic activity.
1.[tco2] is the total <%COO%> dissolved in the ocean, adding all its forms: 
\[\text{tco2} = [CO2] + [H2CO3] + [{HCO3}-] + [CO3^2-].\]
1.[alk] is the ocean alkalinity: the total amount of acid (\hplus) necessary to neutralize the carbonate and bicarbonate in the ocean. The detailed definition is complicated, but to a good approximation, \(\text{alk} = [HCO3^-] + 2 [CO3^2-]\).  This is not crucial for this homework assignment.
1.[CO3] is the concentration of dissolved carbonate ions (<%CARBONATE%>) in the ocean, in moles per cubic meter.
1.[d13Cocn] is the change in the fraction of the carbon-13 (^{13}C) isotope relative to the more common carbon-12 (^{12}C) isotope in the various forms of carbon dissolved in the ocean water.
1.[d13Catm] is the change in the fraction of ^{13}C relative to ^{12}C in atmospheric <%COO%>.
1.[Tatm] is the average air temperature.
1.[Tocn] is the average water temperature of the oceans.

In this homework, you mostly just look at \text{p}CO2, but in exercise 2 in chapter 8, you also have to look at the weathering.
%
% Sometimes you can only see the green line on a graph that has two variables. If this is true, the red line is hidden behind the green line and the two quantities are equal.
%

### Details about the assignment:

1.[Chapter 8, \#1:] Run the model with ""Transition <%COO%> spike"" set to zero and change the <%COO%> degassing rate in the ""Simulation"" box. Examine how changing in the degassing rate affects the atmospheric concentration of <%COO%>\, the time it takes to equilibrate (how can you tell when the atmospheric <%COO%> has reached equilibrium?), and how weathering changes to produce this new equilibrium.
1.[Chapter 8, \#2:]
%**Important: instead of 500 million years ago, do the calculations for 300 million years ago. The model outputs confusing results for 500 million years ago and 300 million years ago gives more reasonable numbers.**

    * First, run the simulation with the transition spike set to zero, the degassing rate set to 7.5 in both the spin-up and the simulation and the  ""Geologic setting"" set to 0 (meaning the present).
    * Then press ""Save model run to background,"" which lets you compare this run to a different run.
    * Next, run the model with the geologic setting at 500 million years ago. The sun was substantially dimmer then. How did this affect
% the temperature and
\text{p}CO2? The original run that you saved (present-day conditions) is labeled as ""Alt"" in the graphs and the current model run is shown without the ""Alt"" label. The simulation is supposed to reflect a steady state, so if you see \text{p}CO2 changing, take a careful look at how much it changes during the two million years the graphs cover (it should not change very much, if at all). How does the average value of \text{p}CO2 compare to today? Why is there such a difference?

1.[Chapter 10, \#1:]Run the model with $\text{year} = 0$, degassing set to 7.5 for both the spin-up and the simulation, and a spike of 1000. If you want, feel free to run it more times with different values for the spike. You're looking for how long it takes \text{p}CO2 to level out and how long it takes \text{p}CO2 to return to its original value (before time zero).

# Exercises from Chapter 3

For the following exercises, use the following numbers:

* I~solar~ = 1350 W/m^2^
* $\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8}$
* $\alpha = 0.30$
* $\varepsilon = 1.0$

```{r layer_model_constants}
I_solar = 1350
alpha = 0.30
sigma = 5.67E-8
epsilon = 1
```

## Worked Example for One-Layer Atmosphere

> **A One-Layer Model.** 

```{r one_layer_figure, fig.cap = ""An energy diagram for a planet with one pane of glass for an atmosphere. The intensity of heat from visible light is $(1 - \\alpha) I_{solar} / 4$.""}
make_layer_diagram(1)
```

> a) Write the energy budgets for the atmospheric layer, for the ground, and for
> the Earth as a whole.

**Answer:** Start at the top, at the boundary to sapce, and work downward:

* At the boundary to space, $I_{1,up} = (1 - \alpha) I_{solar} / 4$.

* At the atmospheric layer, $I_{1,up} + I_{1,down} = I_{ground,up}$

* At the ground, $(1 - \alpha) I_{solar} + I_{1,down} = I_{ground,up}$

We also know that

* $I_{1,up} = I_{1,down} = \varepsilon \sigma T_{1}^4$

* $I_{ground,up} = \sigma T_{ground}^4$


> b) Manipulate the budget for the Earth as a whole to obtain the temperature 
> T~1~ of the atmospheric layer. Does this part of the exercise seem familiar in 
> any way? Does the term ring any bells?

**Answer:** 

$$(1 - \alpha) I_{solar} / 4 = I_{1,up} = \sigma T_{1}^4$$

$$(1 - \alpha) I_{solar} / 4 \varepsilon \sigma = T_{1}^4$$

$$T_{1} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{(1 - \alpha) I_{solar}}{4 \varepsilon \sigma}}$$

This is familiar, because it's the same as the formula for the bare-rock temperature.

Here is R code to calculate $I_{\text{1,up}}$ and $T_1$:

```{r layer_1_temperature}
I_1_up = (1 - alpha) * I_solar / 4
T_1 = (I_1_up / (epsilon * sigma))^0.25
```

From the algebraic solution, we expect T~1~ to be `r format_md(((1 - alpha) * I_solar / (4 * epsilon * sigma))^0.25, digits = 3)` K.
From the R code above, we get T~1~ = `r format_md(T_1, digits = 3)` K.

> c) Now insert the value you found for T~1~ into the budget for atmospheric 
> layer 1 to obtain the temperature of the ground, T~ground~.

**Answer:** 

* $I_{ground} = I_{1,up} + I_{1,down} = 2 \times I_{1,up}$
* $\varepsilon \sigma T_{ground}^4 = 2 \varepsilon \sigma T_{1}^4$
* $T_{ground}^4 = 2 T_{1}^4$
* $T_{ground} = \sqrt[4]{2} \times T_{1}$

And here is R code to calculate $I_{\text{1,down}}$, $I_{\text{ground}}$, and $T_{\text{ground}}$:

```{r ground_temperature}
I_1_down = I_1_up
I_ground = I_1_up + I_1_down
T_ground = (I_ground / (epsilon * sigma))^0.25
```

From the algebraic solution, we get T~ground~ = `r format_md(2^0.25 * T_1, digits = 3)` K and from the R code above, we get T~ground~ = `r format_md(T_ground, digits = 3)` K.

## Exercise 3.1 (Grad. students only)

> **The moon with no heat transport.** The Layer Model assumes that the 
> temperature of the body in space is all the same. This is not really very 
> accurate, as you know that it is colder at the poles than it is at the equator. 
> For a bare rock with no atmosphere or ocean, like the moon, the situation is 
> even worse because fluids like air and water are how heat is carried around on
